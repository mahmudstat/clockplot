R, easiest draw circle using complex equation. unit circle, equation eiθe^{\\theta}, ee Euler’s number, irrational constant approximate value 2.71828; ii stands imaginary unit, equal −1\\sqrt{-1}; θ\\theta refers trigonometric angle radian. make complete circle, need allow θ\\theta take values 0 360 degrees (2π2\\pi radian). Programmatically, need create angles ranging 0 2π2\\pi connect make complete circle. Let us create 100 angles use circle equation (eiθe^{\\theta}). trigonometric form equation sin2θ+cos2θ=1sin^2 \\theta + cos^2 \\theta = 1, algebraic form x2+y2=1x^2+y^2 = 1. complex form, however, convenient. Unit Circle R just takes complex numbers plots values real part X axis corresponding values imaginary part Y axis. Now mark hours circle make look like clock. show 24 hours marks well marks minute marks, corresponding fraction hour. clock slightly different traditional clock 24 hours instead 12, also one hand, hour hand, minute part added hour mark fraction; second part, minor contribution, ignored. First, let us see output 24 hour marks.  time, move R package ggplot2 produce better graphics. need create R data frame plotting ggplots. also mark points minutes. First, let us create required data frame Explanation k = 24 indicates 24 hours. hour divided 4 parts , corresponding elapse successive 15 minutes. Thus, small point @ref(fig:clock24) middle two larger point (hour) means half hour elapsed. instance, point middle 7 PM 8 PM 7:30 PM. Now code exp(1i * 2 * pi * (k:1) / k) gives us angles corresponding 24 hours clock. , note angles trigonometry starts 0o0^o (X-axis) rotates counter-clockwise, direction opposite rotation clock hands (significance difference seen shortly). clock moves clockwise. 0 degree, 3 12-hour clock 6 24-hours clock. Similarly, code SubT = exp(1i * 2 * pi * (subk:1) / subk) gives us angles corresponding fraction hour. already mentioned, clock hand rotates clock-wise, starting 0o0^o angle, name labels 6 PM 11 PM, 12 PM 11 PM, followed 12 5 . code c(rep(\" \",6), rep(\" PM\",12), rep(\" \",6)) ensures sequence. place data two data frames subtimes dfclock, since unequal dimensions.  Next, plot lines using ggplot2 package. functions geom_path() job, geom_line() used fill gap first last point. aspect.ratio = 1 set ensure chart size depend resizing Rstudio Viewer size. points corresponding hours labelled PM using geom_text() function. need axis labels ticks. Let us remove :  completes first part plot; get skeleton clock. second final part task involves plotting event times appropriate points. Now, task several variations. simplest form, just chart, called clock_chart, plots event times 24-hour clock. optional argument Col can used change color clock hands. variations discussed later, complete discussion event times prepared plotting.","code":"k <- 100 timepoint <- exp(1i * 2 * pi * (k:1) / k) plot(timepoint, pch = 19, type = \"b\") k <- 24 hour <- exp(1i * 2 * pi * (k:1) / k) plot(hour, pch = 19) k <- 24 # Hours subk <- 24*4 # Fraction of hours times <- exp(1i * 2 * pi * (k:1) / k) subtimes <- data.frame(SubT = exp(1i * 2 * pi * (subk:1) / subk))  ampm = c(rep(\" AM\",6), rep(\" PM\",12), rep(\" AM\",6)) library(tibble) dfclock <- tibble(time = times,                   hour = c(6:12, 1:12, 1:5), # May not be needed                   label = paste0(c(6:12, 1:5), ampm)) library(ggplot2) # Load the package ggplot2 p1 <- dfclock %>% ggplot()+   geom_path(data = subtimes, aes(Re(SubT), Im(SubT)))+   # Connect Last two missing points   geom_line(data = subtimes %>% dplyr::slice(-c(2:95)), aes(Re(SubT), Im(SubT)))+   theme(aspect.ratio = 1)+   geom_text(data = dfclock, aes(Re(time)*1.1, Im(time)*1.1, label = label))+   geom_point(data = subtimes,               aes(Re(SubT), Im(SubT)), shape = 19, color = \"black\", size = 0.6)+   geom_point(aes(Re(time), Im(time)), color = \"black\", size = 1.8) p1 p1 + theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),          axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),          axis.text.y=element_blank(),           axis.ticks.y=element_blank())+   labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")"},{"path":"https://mahmudstat.github.io/clockplot/articles/clockchart-construction.html","id":"preparation-of-event-times-data","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"The Clock Skeleton","what":"Preparation of Event Times Data","title":"clockchart-construction","text":"data format HH:MM:SS. need convert data (x,y) coordinates. unit circle, example, 12 plotted Y-axis (x = 0, y = 1) 6 X axis (x = 1, y = 0), although, avoid plotting circumference, decrease length little (later). convert HH:MM:SS coordinates unit circle, first separate parts time HH, MM, SS. accomplish using dplyr tidyr package. gives us hour, minute, second character (chr) vectors, need numeric vectors. conversion made .numeric function. challenge now combine hour minute one singe time, later convert coordinate. intentionally ignore second (SS), since negligible contribution plot. short algorithm used: Note 30 minutes equivalent half hour, 1:30:00 corresponds 1.5 hour. need recall time values range 0 60, decimal number system gives us suitable range 1 100. number system, reaching 100 indicates completed work, clockworks say reaching 60 completes one cycle task. hour part need conversion. 23 23 22 22.
