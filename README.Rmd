The primary goal of clockplot is to plot event time on a clock chart. Additionally it 
helps you make a day chart, week chart, or month chart, or plan events in 
those periods.

## Installation

You can install the development version of clockplot from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mahmudstat/clockplot")
```

## Usage

[Click here](https://mahmudstat.github.io/clockplot/reference/index.html) to 
see all the available functions. 

### Clock Chart

```{r example}
#| fig.alt = "Clock chart of random event times based on a random sample."
library(clockplot)

set.seed(10)
df <- tibble::tibble(hr = sample(0:23, 50, replace = TRUE),
                  mnt = sample(0:59, 50, replace = TRUE),
                  sec = sample(0:59, 50, replace = TRUE),
                  time = paste(hr, mnt, sec, sep = ":"),
                  value = sample(60,50))
p1 <- clock_chart_qnt(df, time, crit = value)
p1 + ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "right")+
ggplot2::labs(title = "Clock chart of random values")
```

### Week Chart

```{r week-chart}
#| fig.alt = "Week chart of Temperature"
set.seed(15)
wtemp <- sample(10:40,7)
week_chart(wtemp, high = "yellow", lgnm = "Temperature")
```
